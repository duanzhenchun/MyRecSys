these are the codes of my project in lab.   
Basing on it, I ran experiments and wrote a paper.

I use python to handle part of the data processing job,  including:  
1. split the data in training set and testing set    
2. build the social network basing on the social data and run BFS on it to search friends for each user   
3. plot results   

part of the code will rely on the extra lib "SNAP", so you should copy the "snap.py"  
and "_snap.pyd" intofiles such as baiduPy

I use matlab to implement several traditional and state of the art recommendation methods, including:  
1.User based CF  
2.Item based CF  
3.SVD  
4.SocialMF  
5.CF-ULF / PureTrust / Trust-CF-ULF  (three novel user based CF methods)  
6.Self organizing maps (SOM) neural networt  
7.my own algorithms
